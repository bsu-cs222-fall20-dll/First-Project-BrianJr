This project was to create an Application using JavaFX that pulls in data from Wikipedia using the Mediawiki API. The data is to be parsed, and displayed on screen via a GUI.

There are 2 suppressed warnings in the Controller class:
   -
   The warnings occur because the parameter 'actionEvent' is
   unused in the methods 'showMostActiveEditors' & 'timeStamp'.
   The parameter needs to be there as it ties everything together.
